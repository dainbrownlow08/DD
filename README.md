# Food Connect
Did you know that 30-40% of the food produced in America each year is wasted? Our mission at Food Connect is to link Grocery Stores, Foobanks, and volunteer drivers in an effort to redirect useable food items that would otherwise be thrown away. As a Food Bank you can browse grocery store inventory and create trips to be added to the queue for volunteers to pick up. As a Volunteer you can browse and sign up for avaivble trips, with data provided on each trip. Thanks for visiting!
